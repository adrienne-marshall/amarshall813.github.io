# About me

# Biography

I'm a PhD student in Water Resources at the University of Idaho and an NSF IGERT fellow. 
I"m interested in ecohydrology in forested and mountainous environments, with a particular interest in hydrological questions that 
advance our understanding of how to manage water resources under climate change. My favorite tools for answering these questions are 
data science, hydrological modeling, and remote sensing.

# Educational background

## MS in Energy and Resources, UC Berkeley
I graduated from UC Berkeley with a MS in Energy and Resources in 2014. My master's project addressed the effects of changing hydroclimate
on the timing of wilderness visitation, using a combination of blogs, permit data, and snowpack and streamflow data. While at Berkeley,
I also worked with UC Cooperative Extension to develop a publication for landowners about impacts of climate change on California forests
and practical strategies for adaptation.

## BA in Biology, Scripps College
In 2009, I graduated from Scripps College with a BA in Biology and minor in french. My senior thesis identified proteins in aging 
mice that showed high levels of oxidative damage.

# Personal and Professional Background
Between my BA and MS, I worked in environmental education for 5 years, with Foothill Horizons Outdoor School and NatureBridge, a 
leader in environmental education. During that time, I also hiked across the country on the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide Trails,
experiencing the incredible landscapes of the American west. In my spare time, I love to hike, run, snowshoe and cross-country ski, and 
paint landscapes.
